    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Buffalo chicken mac and cheese recipe was first introduced to me at my local ballpark, and I thought it was a great idea! This is what I whipped up. Serve with celery sticks and beer. Let me know what you think.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup hot sauce (such as Frank's® Redhot®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Remove skin and bones from wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
